The end users guide to pyborg
=============================

You talk to it: it talks back! What's not to love!


Some commands your local pyborg might have in your chat room:

 * !words
 * !info
 * !help

Garfield Mode
=============

Garfield mode is a wonderful new feature in the discord module. 

Notably it adds the commands:

 * !leave / !part
 * !garf / !garfmode

Who knows what that does though!
